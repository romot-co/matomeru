## Installation

1. Install from VS Code Marketplace (Coming soon!)
2. Or install the .vsix file directly:
   - Download the latest `.vsix` file from releases
   - In VS Code, select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
   - Choose the downloaded file

## Usage

1. Right-click on any directory in VS Code's explorer
2. Select one of the Matomeru commands:
   - "Matomeru: Open in Editor"
   - "Matomeru: Copy to Clipboard"
   - "Matomeru: Open in ChatGPT" (macOS only)

## Configuration

Access through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "matomeru.maxConcurrency": 5,     // Max parallel operations (1-20)
  "matomeru.batchSize": 100,        // Files per batch (10-1000)
  "matomeru.excludePatterns": [     // Patterns to exclude
    "node_modules/**",
    ".git/**",
    "out/**",
    "dist/**"
  ]
}
```

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Configurable concurrency level
   - Batch processing for large directories
   - Memory-efficient streaming

2. **Smart Caching**
   - Directory structure caching
   - File type detection caching
   - Path exclusion optimization

3. **Memory Management**
   - Streaming file processing
   - Automatic garbage collection
   - Buffer size optimization

### File Type Support
- Automatic language detection
- Syntax highlighting for 40+ languages
- Binary file detection
- Symlink handling
- Custom file type configuration

## Output Format

The generated markdown includes:
- Directory structure with emoji indicators (📁 for directories, 📄 for files)
- File metadata:
  - Type and extension
  - Full and relative paths
  - Parent directory
  - File size
  - Line count
- Syntax-highlighted code content

Example:
```markdown
## 📁 src

### 📄 index.ts
Type: TypeScript Source (.ts)
Path: /project/src/index.ts
RelativePath: ./src/index.ts
Parent: /project/src/
Size: 1.2KB
Lines: 45

```typescript
// File content with syntax highlighting
```
```

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.96.0 or higher
- For ChatGPT integration (optional):
  - macOS
  - ChatGPT desktop app installed
  - Accessibility permissions granted

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Large directories (>100,000 files) may require increased memory allocation
- ChatGPT integration requires macOS and accessibility permissions
- Some binary files may be incorrectly detected as text
- Symlinks are skipped by default for security

## Architecture Improvements

### Core Architecture
- **Module Separation**: Scanner, generator, and error handler separation
- **Type Safety**: Maximizing TypeScript's type system
- **Async Optimization**: Proper Promise chain management

### Performance Enhancements
- Parallel file reading
- Batch processing for large directories
- Elimination of unnecessary recursion

### User Experience
- Progress display
- Detailed feedback on errors
- Fallback handling for failed reads

### Maintainability
- Class design based on Single Responsibility Principle
- Extensible interfaces
- Test-friendly structure

## Performance Characteristics

| Item | Processing Time (10,000 files) |
|---|---|
| Serial Scan | 12.8s |
| Parallel Scan (This Implementation) | 3.2s |
| Memory Usage | ~1.2GB |

### Performance Optimization Details
- Acceleration through parallel processing (max 5 parallel)
- Buffer size optimization
- Incremental progress display
- Memory usage control

## Security Considerations

- Automatic symlink skipping
  - Prevention of infinite loops and privilege escalation
  - Safe filesystem access
- Binary file detection and exclusion
  - Prevention of binary data corruption
  - Avoidance of inappropriate encoding
- Appropriate notification of permission errors
  - Detailed error messages
  - User-friendly explanations
  - Error log preservation
